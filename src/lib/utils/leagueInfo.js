  <p>Founded in 2021, The League of Leagues (LoL) is a 10-Team dynasty fantasy football league formed by the top redraft players within a small group of friends. Each year, the manager from each dynasty team competes for the coveted League of Leagues Championship, and competes to stay out of the dreaded Toilet Bowl.</p>
  <p>The leadership of the League of Leagues is NFL analyst and fantasy enthuiast, Luke Lanier, along with his top henchman, Trevbot and Tones. These three have led the league through highs and lows with astuteness and poise.</p>
  <p>What changes will we have in store for 2022 and onward? Each dynasty manager can only dream more and more as they dive head first into the coming seasons.</p>
  <p>Now, the fiscal incentives for the LoL is as follows: 1st - $350 , 2nd - $100 , 3rd - $50 .</p>
  <p>Gentleman, strap in for a journey of a lifetime competing for years to come in the League of Leagues!</p>
